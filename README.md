# Exercise Boolean : Playstation HomePage

## STEPS

### Step 1 : Analysis of the layout

For any modern it's good practice to start with a **mobile-first** approach for the layout considering the current market.  
In the **mobile layout** most elements are stacked vertically, therefore it's quite easy to divide it into separate logical sections. 

#### Division of webpage document: 

1. DIV - Sony Logo :  
    this is a very simple section with a dark background and white **SONY logo**. It's almost an **aesthetic element** so I think it would be better to **not use any headings** for this.  
2. NAV - nav-bar :
    This is the **main navigation** bar of the entire document. So, particular attention should be put to its **functionality and accessibility(ARIA)**.
    It contains the website's **H1** Heading that should be visually hidden, but present near the Playstation Logo. 
3. [main] HEADER - carousel : 
    This section in the main is separate in its function from the other ones present below. It's the main focus when the page is loaded, therefore I decided to categorize it as a header for the main. 
    To implement its function we can make use of the **carousel **utilities and functionalities present in Bootstrap. 
4. [main] SECTION - playstation-products : 
    A **call-to-action** section that showcases to the user a selection of Playstation products, starting from the Playstation 5. 
5. [main] SECTION - popular-games : 
    A full size banner showcasing the popular games right now on Playstation 5.
